# Building a UFO Webpage
## Overview
The purpose of this is analysis is to build a webpage using Javascript and HTML. With the data given to us, we built code that would add the information into the webpage. We would then build code to be able to filter the data on multiple criteria. The data posted is arranged in a dynamic table with multiple columns.
## Results
With the webpage we have created, users can input any filter they want and the table will automatically refresh with the data that was found. The images below will show the webpage when no filter is applied and one where there is a filter applied.

As we can see, we applied a filter for a country that was not in the data, so the search brought back no results. For filters to successfully be applied, the proper input must be followed. If it is not followed, the search will come up blank.
## Summary
### Drawbacks
Some drawbacks of this new design is that the user has to know the specific inputs. New users may not know that, for example, a few of the sightings have a shape of "unknown". There is also the drawback of how everything must be typed in lowercase and spacing must be used appropriately. There is also no warning for, incorrect inputs.
### Recommendations
A few recommendations that can be given to this page is to make it more user-friendly. We can add functions that will display when an input was incorrectly typed, or we can also just add more ways in which they can be typed. For example, we could let words be typed out with upper cases and the results should still work. We could also add a function that constantly adds new data to the webpage. Something like web scraping, this way our data is constantly being updated for more people to search.
