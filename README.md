# Building a UFO Webpage
## Overview
The purpose of this is analysis is to build a webpage using Javascript and HTML. With the data given to us, we built code that would add the information into the webpage. We would then build code to be able to filter the data on multiple criteria. The data posted is arranged in a dynamic table with multiple columns.
## Results
With the webpage we have created, users can input any filter they want and the table will automatically refresh with the data that was found. The images below will show the webpage when no filter is applied and one where there is a filter applied.
